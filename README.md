# Mathematical-Expression-Simplifier
Project I completed in 2014 that takes mathematical expression with any number of variables and simplifies it.

Takes a mathematical expressions and returns the expression in its simplest form.
Simplification works by examining the expression and checking to see if it can be simplified using a known process.
When a problem can't be simplified using a known method it is broken down into two halves, left (l) and right (r).
This process is applied to each half recursively.
This happens to each subsequent half until a problem is simplified as much as possible.
